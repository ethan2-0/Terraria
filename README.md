<h1>OpenTerraria</h1><br/>
OpenTerraria is an attempt to create an opensource Terraria, hence the name.<br/>
It is developed in .NET, and will have some success on Wine 1.7.11/Mono 3.2.6 with the windowscodecs winetrick installed.<br/>
Currently, there are a few known bugs:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>On Wine/Mono, performance is horrible</li>
	<li>On large monitors, the rendering will appear to have a part of a pizza wedge taken out of it. This is a byproduct of the rendering code. It will just require some optimization.</li>
	<li>In a dual-monitor configuration, if OpenTerraria starts up on the smaller monitor, it will not look right on the larger monitor.</li>
</ul>
